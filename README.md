This is a folder of the problems and exercises of the book *Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People*, as well as personal implementations of the algorithms. Currently, I have not taken a computer science course beyond *Computer Science I*, and so my implementations may not be the most aesthetic or efficient. However, I am doing this to improve my programming skills and know-how.
